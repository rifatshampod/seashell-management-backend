Challenge: James collects seashells with his sister Anna. They have an extensive collection of seashells and have a hard time tracking the seashells. They have decided they need an app that communicates with a backend to see the whole collection of seashells. James and Anna have asked for your help to implement the backend.

Requirements: Your backend should be able to complete the following tasks:
- Add a new seashell (Name, Species, Description, etc.)
- Remove seashells
- Edit seashells
- List all of the seashells
- Persist data using a database of your choice
- Easy to consume API documentation for the frontend developer

Grading: The grading will be based on three criteria:
- 30% - API documentation
- 30% - Data management and store
- 40% - Overall design and structure
